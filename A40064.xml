            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <l>To pardon willing, and to punish loath,</l>
               <l>You strike with one hand, but you heal with both.</l>
               <l>Lifting up all that prostrate lye, you grieve</l>
               <l>You cannot make the dead again to live.</l>
               <l>When Fate or Error had our Age misled,</l>
               <l>And o're these Nations such Confusion spread,</l>
               <l>The only Cure which could from Heaven come down,</l>
               <l>Was so much Power and Clemency in one;</l>
               <l>One whose Extraction is from an Ancient Line,</l>
               <l>Gives hope again that well-born Men may shine:</l>
               <l>The meanest in your Nature, mild and good,</l>
               <l>The noble rest secur'd in your Blood.</l>
               <l>Oft have we wonder'd how you hid in Peace</l>
               <l>A Mind proportion'd to such things as these:</l>
               <l>How such a Ruling Spirit could restrain,</l>
               <l>And practice first o're your own self to Reign.</l>
               <l>Your private Life did a just Pattern give,</l>
               <l>How Fathers, Husbands, Pious Sons should live.</l>
               <l>Born to Command, your Princely Vertues slept</l>
               <l>Like humble <hi>David,</hi> whilst the Flock he kept;</l>
               <l>But when your troubled Country call'd you forth,</l>
               <l>Your flaming Courage, and your matchless Worthâ–ª</l>
               <l>Dazling the Eyes of all that did pretend</l>
               <l>To sow Contentionâ€”gave a prosperous end</l>
               <l>Still as you rise, the States exalted too,</l>
               <l>Finds no Distemper while it's chang'd by you:</l>
               <l>Chang'd like the World's great Scene, when without noise</l>
               <l>The rising Sun Night's vulgar Lights destroys.</l>
               <l>Had you some Ages past this Race of Glory</l>
               <l>Run, with amazement we should read your Story.</l>
               <l>But living Vertue all Atchievements past,</l>
               <l>Meets Envy still to grapple with at last.</l>
               <l>This <hi>Caesar</hi> found, and that ungrateful Age</l>
               <l>With losing him, fell back to Blood and Rage.</l>
               <l>Mistaken <hi>Brutus</hi> thought to break their Yoak,</l>
               <l>But cut the Bond of Union at that stroke.</l>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:40612:4"/>
               <l>That Sun once set, a thousand meaner Stars</l>
               <l>Gave a dim light to Violence and Wars.</l>
               <l>To such a Tempest as now threatens all,</l>
               <l>Did not your mighty Arm prevent the fall.</l>
               <l>If <hi>Rome</hi>'s great Senate could not wield the Sword,</l>
               <l>Which of the conquer'd World had made them Lord,</l>
               <l>What hope had ours, while yet their power was new,</l>
               <l>To Rule victorious Armies, but by you?</l>
               <l>You that had taught them to subdue their Foes,</l>
               <l>Could Order teach, and all their Hearts compose.</l>
               <l>To every Duty could their Minds engage,</l>
               <l>Provoke their Courage, and commend their Rage.</l>
               <l>So when a Lion shakes his dreadful Main,</l>
               <l>And angry grows, if he that first took pain</l>
               <l>To tame his Youth, approach the haughty Beast,</l>
               <l>He bends to him, but frights away the rest.</l>
               <l>As the vext World, to find repose at last</l>
               <l>It self into <hi>Augusta</hi>'s Arms did cast.</l>
               <l>So <hi>England</hi> now does, with like Toyl opprest,</l>
               <l>Her weary Head upon your Bosom rest.</l>
               <l>Then let the Muses with such Notes as these</l>
               <l>Instruct us what belongs unto our Peace:</l>
               <l>Your Battels they hereafter shall indite,</l>
               <l>And draw the Image of our <hi>Mars</hi> in Fight.</l>
               <l>Tell of Towns storm'd, of Armies over run,</l>
               <l>And mighty Kingdoms by your Conduct won:</l>
               <l>How while you thunder'd, clouds of dust did choak,</l>
               <l>Contending Troops and Seas lay hid in Smoak.</l>
               <l>Illustrious Arts high raptures do infuse,</l>
               <l>And every Conqueror creates a Muse.</l>
               <l>Here in low strains your milder deeds we sing,</l>
               <l>But there, my Lord, we'll Bays and Olives bringâ–ª</l>
               <l>To Crown your Head, while you in Triumph rideâ–ª</l>
               <l>O're vanquish'd Nations, and the Sea beside;</l>

                  <l>And nodding Sleep dropt on my drowsie Head.</l>
                  <l>At last the Summons of a busie Bell,</l>
                  <l>And glimmering Lights did Sleeps kind Mists dispel.</l>
                  <l>From Bed I stole, and creeping by the Wall,</l>
                  <l>Thro' a small Chink I spy'd a Spacious Hall.</l>
                  <l>Tapers as thick as Stars did shed their Light</l>
                  <l>Around the place, and made a day of Night.</l>
                  <l>The curious Art of some great Master's hand,</l>
                  <l>Adorn'd the Roomâ€”<hi>Hâ€”Câ€”P</hi>â€”stand</l>
                  <l>In one large piece, next them the two <hi>Dutch</hi> Wars,</l>
                  <l>In bloody Colours paint our fatal Jars.</l>
                  <l>Here <hi>London</hi> Flames in Clouds of smoke aspire,</l>
                  <l>Done to the life, I'de almost cry'd out Fire.</l>
                  <l>But living Figures did my Eyes divert</l>
                  <l>From those, and many more of wondrous Art.</l>
                  <l>There entred in three Mercenary Bands,</l>
                  <l>(The different Captains had distinct Commands)</l>
                  <l>The Begger's desperate Troop did first appear,</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Littleton</hi> led, proud <hi>Seymore</hi> had the Rear.</l>
                  <l>The disguis'd Papists under <hi>Garroway,</hi>

                  <l>
                     <hi>Talbot</hi> Lieutenant (none had better pay)</l>
                  <l>Next greedy <hi>Lee</hi> led Party colour'd Slaves,</l>

                  <l>Brought up by <hi>Mâ€”grave,</hi> then a Nobler Train,</l>
                  <l>(In Malice mighty, impotent in Brain)</l>
                  <l>The Pope's Solicitor brought into th' Hall,</l>
                  <l>Not guilty Lay much guilty Spiritual.</l>
                  <l>I also spy'd behind a private Skreen,</l>

                  <l>Dire threats I hear'd, the Hall did Eccho Death.</l>
                  <l>A Curtain drawn, another Scene appear'd,</l>
                  <l>A tinckling Bell, a mumbling Priest I heard.</l>
                  <l>At Elevation every Knee ador'd</l>
                  <l>The Baker's Craft, Infallible's vain Lord.</l>
                  <l>When <hi>Cataline</hi> with Vipers did conspire,</l>

                  <l>A Sacramental Bowl of Humane Goare,</l>
                  <l>Each Villain took, and as he drank he swore.</l>
                  <l>The Cup deny'd, to make their Plot compleat,</l>
                  <l>These <hi>Catalines</hi> their conjur'd Gods did eat.</l>
                  <l>Whilst to their Breaden Whimseys they did kneel,</l>
                  <l>I crept away, and to the door did steal.</l>
                  <l>As I got out, by Providence I flew,</l>
                  <l>To this close Wood, too late they did pursue.</l>

               <l>Large Oaks up by the roots are torn,</l>
               <l>The Savage Train</l>
               <l>Upon the Forest or the Plain</l>
               <l>To a procession through the Sky are born,</l>

               <l>But when that Heav'n designs, the Brave</l>

            <head>A Satyr in Answer to a Friend.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>'TIS strange that you, to whom I've long been known,</l>
               <l>Should ask me why I alwaies rail at th' Town?</l>
               <l>As a good Hound when he runs near his Prey,</l>
               <l>With double eagerness is hard to Bay,</l>
               <l>So when a Coxcomb doth offend my fight,</l>
               <l>To ease my Spleen, I straight go home and write.</l>
               <l>I love to bring Vice ill conceal'd to light.</l>
               <l>And I have found that they that Satyr write,</l>
               <l>Alone can season the useful with the sweet.</l>
               <l>Should I write Songs, and to cool Shades confin'd,</l>
               <l>Expire with Love, who hate all Woman kind!</l>
               <l>Then in my Closet, like some fighting Sparks,</l>
               <l>Thinking on <hi>Phillis</hi> Love upon my works!</l>
               <l>I grant I might with bolder Muse inspir'd,</l>
               <l>Some <hi>Hero</hi> sing worthy to be admir'd.</l>
               <l>Our King hath Qualities might entertain,</l>

               <l>But then you'l own no man is thought his Friend,</l>
               <l>That doth not love the Pope and <hi>York</hi> commend.</l>
               <l>He who his Evil Counsellors dislikes,</l>
               <l>Say what he will still like a Traytor speaks.</l>
               <l>Now I Dissimulation cannot bear,</l>
               <l>Truth and good Sence my lines alike must share.</l>
               <l>I love to call each Creature by his Name,</l>

               <l>The careful Face of Ministers of State,</l>
               <l>I alwaies judg'd to be a downright cheat.</l>
               <l>The smiling Courtier, and the Counsellour Grave,</l>
               <l>I alwaies thought two different Marks of Knave.</l>
               <l>They that talk loud, and they that draw i'th' Pit,</l>
               <l>These want of Courage shew, those want of Wit.</l>
               <l>Thus all the world endeavours to appear,</l>

               <l>In a soft tone without one word of Sence,</l>

               <l>And when at last by a thousand different Crimes,</l>

               <l>How a great Lord, in numbers soft, thought fit,</l>
               <l>(Though void of Sense, to set up for a Wit.)</l>

               <l>An Epitaph to Cruel <hi>Cloris</hi> pen'd;</l>
               <l>His Name (I think) I hardly need to tell,</l>

               <l>The senseless Tricks of every silly Peer,</l>
               <l>I'd as good tell how many several ways,</l>
               <l>The trusty Duke his Country still betrays.</l>
               <l>How full the World is stufft with Knave and Fool,</l>
               <l>How to be very Honest is counted dull.</l>
               <l>How to speak plain, and greatness to despise,</l>
               <l>Is thought a Madness, but Flattery is Wise,</l>
               <l>Dissimulation excellent, to cheat a Friend</l>
               <l>A very Trifle, provided still our end</l>
               <l>Be but the Snare we call our Interest,</l>
               <l>Then nothing is bad, but that is best;</l>
               <l>I'le therefore end this vain Satyrick rage,</l>
               <l>And leave the Bishops to reform the Age.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>OF a Tall Statue, and of Sable Hue;</l>
               <l>Much like the Son of <hi>Kish,</hi> that Lofty <hi>Jew.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Twelve years compleat he suffered in Exile,</l>
               <l>And kept his Fâ€”thers Asses all the while.</l>
               <l>At length by wonderfull Impulse of Fate,</l>
               <l>The People call him Home to help the State.</l>
               <l>And what is more, they send him Money too,</l>
               <l>And Cloath him All, from Head to Foot, a-new.</l>
               <l>Nor did he such small Favours then Disdain,</l>
               <l>But in his Thirtieth year began his Reign:</l>
               <l>In a slasht Doublet then he came ashore,</l>
               <l>And dubb'd poor <hi>Pâ€”mer</hi>'s Wife his Royal Whâ€”.</l>
               <l>Bishops and Deans, Peers, Pimps, and Knights he made,</l>
               <l>Things highly fitting for a Monarch's trade;</l>
               <l>With Women, Wine, and Viands of Delight,</l>
               <l>His Jolly Vassals feast him Day and Night:</l>
               <l>But the Best Times have ever some allay,</l>
               <l>His younger Brother dy'd by Treachery.</l>
               <l>Bold <hi>Yâ€”k</hi> survives to be the Nation's Curse,</l>
               <l>Resolv'd to Ruine it by Deceit or Force.</l>
               <l>Now the Court-Sins did every place defile,</l>
               <l>And Plagues, and War, fell heavy on the Isle.</l>
               <l>Pride nourisht Folly, Folly a Delight,</l>
               <l>With the <hi>Battavian</hi> Common-wealth to fight:</l>
               <l>But the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet fled suddenly with Fear,</l>
               <l>Death and the <hi>Duke</hi> so dreadfull did appear.</l>
               <l>The dreadfull Victor took his soft Repose,</l>
               <l>Scorning pursuit of such Mecannick Foes.</l>
               <l>But now <hi>Yâ€”k</hi>'s Genitals grew over-hot,</l>
               <l>With <hi>Dâ€”ham</hi> and <hi>Câ€”eige</hi>'s infected Pot;</l>
               <l>Which, with Religion, so inflam'd his Ire,</l>

               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:40612:11"/>
               <l>So <hi>Philip</hi>'s Son, inflamed with a Miss,</l>
               <l>Burnt down the Palace of <hi>Persepolis.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Foil'd thus by <hi>Venus,</hi> he <hi>Bellona</hi> woo's,</l>
               <l>And with the <hi>Dutch</hi> a second War renews.</l>
               <l>But here his <hi>French</hi>-bred Prowess prov'd in vain,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>De Ruyter</hi> claps him in <hi>Sole</hi>'s Bay again.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>BElieve me, <hi>Will,</hi> that those who have least sence,</l>
               <l>Think they to Wisdom have the sole Pretence;</l>
               <l>And that those Wretches who in <hi>Bedlam</hi> are,</l>
               <l>Deserve it less, than those who put 'em there.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The haughty Pedant, swoln with the frothy Name</l>
               <l>Of a learn'd Man, big with his Classick Fame,</l>
               <l>A thousand Books, read o'er and o'er again,</l>
               <l>Does word for word most perfectly retain,</l>
               <l>Heap'd in the Lumber-Office of his Brain;</l>
               <l>Yet this cramm'd Skull, this indigested Mass,</l>
               <l>Does very often prove an arrant Ass:</l>
               <l>Believes all Knowledge is to Books confin'd,</l>
               <l>That Reading only can inform the Mind;</l>
               <l>That Sence must err, and Reason ramble wide,</l>

               <l>Whose Life's a Visit, who alone takes care</l>
               <l>To say fine Things, write Songs, and Court the Fair;</l>
               <l>Laughs at the musty Precepts of the School,</l>
               <l>Calls the learn'd Writer an Authentick Fool;</l>
               <l>Swears, that all Learning is a thing unfit,</l>
               <l>A well-bred Person, or a Man of Wit;</l>

               <l>Who bears down all that stops him in his way;</l>
               <l>Ranges o'er all, and takes his Savage fill</l>

               <l>Laughs at the Fools, and at the Villain rails;</l>

               <l>While the crack'd Skull shows all that has been said,</l>

               <l>Whose thirst of Wealth increases with his store,</l>
               <l>And to spend less, still covets to have more;</l>
               <l>Who, <hi>Midas</hi>-like, to feed his Avarice,</l>
               <l>Starves in th' enjoyment of a golden Wish:</l>
               <l>Thinks himself Wise, boasts of being Provident,</l>
               <l>And down-right Scraping, calls good Management.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Love of Wealth, is Madness; and I hate</l>
               <l>The very Trouble of a great Estate:</l>
               <l>'Tis perfect Dirt, cries the vain Prodigal,</l>
               <l>Mad till it's gone; and, when he has spent all,</l>
               <l>The Begger'd Fool, calls himself Liberal.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Now weigh 'em both, and tell me, if you can,</l>

               <l>That Fortune-monger, maddest of the Three,</l>
               <l>Whose Life, whose Soul, whose very Heav'n is Play,</l>
               <l>At which the Bubble throws 'em all away:</l>
               <l>Who every moment waits his Destiny,</l>
               <l>From the uncertain running of a Dye;</l>
               <l>And if he chance to lose, then how he stares!</l>
               <l>Then how the Fury, with his frisled hairs,</l>
               <l>Curses his Fate! Earth, Hell, and Heav'n defies,</l>

               <l>HOW dull, and how insensible a Beast</l>
               <l>Is Man, who yet would Lord it o'er the rest:</l>
               <l>Philosophers and Poets vainly strove</l>
               <l>In every Age the lumpish Mass to move;</l>
               <l>But those were Pedants, when compar'd with these,</l>
               <l>Who know not only to instruct, but please.</l>
               <l>Poets alone found the delightfull way,</l>
               <l>Mysterious Morals gently to conveyâ–ª</l>
               <l>In charming Numbers; so that as Men grow</l>
               <l>Pleas'd with their Poems, they grew wiser too.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Satyr</hi> has always shone among the rest,</l>
               <l>And is the boldest way, if not the best,</l>
               <l>To tell Men freely of their foulest faults,</l>
               <l>To laugh at their vain Deeds, and vainer Thoughts.</l>
               <l>In Satyr too the Wise took different ways,</l>
               <l>To each deserving its peculiar praise.</l>
               <l>Some did all Folly with just sharpness blame,</l>
               <l>Whilst others laugh'd and scorn'd them into shame.</l>
               <l>But of these two, the last succeeded best,</l>
               <l>(As Men aim rightest when they shoot in jest:)</l>
               <l>Yet if we may presume to blame our Guides,</l>
               <l>And Censure those who Censure all besides.</l>
               <l>In other things they justly are preferr'd,</l>
               <l>In this alone me-thinks the Ancients err'd;</l>

               <l>It seems stupendious, and above reward.</l>
               <l>Now labour with unequal force to climb</l>
